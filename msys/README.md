# QueenKJuul's msys2 Setup Script

This will start with a modified version of my Ubuntu configuration script, which I am designing to be able to configure a VPS to my basic taste from one command. 

This one will hopefully be able to set up a full MSYS2 environment on a fresh Windows installation, in case I someday am using Win10 VMs (idk why I would...maybe if I figure out a VFIO situation on my desktop?) or just in the regrettable event that I have to reinstall my Windows system from scratch (which I have another repo on github to track most of my changes to Win10, though most of those probably can't be scripted)

As of now, though, this is just a placeholder README as I have not started on the msys script at all yet (or, for that matter, the ubuntu one either)
