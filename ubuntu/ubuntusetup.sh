# queenkjuul fish setup script for ubuntu
# this should, in theory, get a new VPS ubuntu instance all up to date, and 
# running everything I want. Designed around my first digitalocean droplets, 
# I am not sure if this will need to change for other VPS providers as I have
# never used any other VPS provider
#
# The goal is to have a script that I will run as root hosted on my github
# that will quickly and easily get a new VPS set up with my personal 
# quality-of-life stuff. 
#
# for details, see README.md
